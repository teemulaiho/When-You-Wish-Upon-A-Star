Common Quest: What happened to living off the grid!
The old Cartesian scholars believed the world to be flat and according to H. Lewis it is hip to be square.

Pass Requirements:
 Create a grid-based 2D world (Flat 2 dimensional grid/map/field of squares/cells/tiles).
 The grid needs to be displayed on the screen.
 Each grid should have a property if they are blocked or not.
 At the start, randomize all grid squares to be a random starting type and blocked/non-blocked.
 Graphically display if a grid is blocked or not or contains a specific entity.
 The student must implement the ability for the teacher to change, place and remove entities
and grid types in the grid world to sufficiently test the algorithms.

Common Quest: Starchaser Orin!
The job description of the starchaser is quite daunting but on the other hand quite simple Find a star, get
the star and sell the star.

Pass Requirements:
 Create an Spaceship Entity and place on random non-blocked square (visually represented)
 Create an Trading Post Entity and place on a random non-blocked square (visually represented)
 Create a Fallen Star Entity and place on a random non-blocked square (visually represented)
 Create a Starchaser Entity and place on a random non-blocked square, the Starchaser utilizes a
Finite State Machine (FSM) and A* to:
o Find and travel to pick up the Fallen Star
o Find and travel to the Trading Post to sell the Fallen Star
o Find and travel to the Spaceship to rest.
o The Starchaser has stamina that is reduced for every step they take while carrying the
Fallen Star, if stamina reaches zero they will drop the Fallen Star on the square they are
standing in and go rest in the Spaceship.
 Visualize the path the Starchaser is following.

Epic Quest: Searching, Jumping, Pointing, Grabbing and Cheering!
It takes too long! You are doing it to slow! Hurry master! I heard jumping and pointing while searching is
something that is faster!

Pass Requirements:
 Implement Jump-Point Search algorithm (JSP)
 Implement the ability to select if the Starchaser should use A* or JPS when pathfinding,
